        The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his friend 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth 
        and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>,
        one of the first highly sucessful mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984,
        the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface). After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee
        the creation of two new companies: NeXT computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>. With the success of 
        the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire.

        In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft domiinated the computer industry, and Apple was on the brink 
        of extinction. Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was fantastic salesman</a>,
        and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to profitability.
