## Rendering Practice 

1. Create three pages with EJS
    * home, with route `localhost:3000/`
    * about, with route `localhost:3000/about`
    * contact, with route `localhost:3000/contact`

1. Create headings as follows
    * On the home page, create an `h1` that says “Welcome to the home page!” 
    * On the about page, create an h1 that says “Welcome to the about page!” 
    * On the contact page, create an h1 that says “Welcome to the contact page!”

1. Next we will be passing variables from your `index.js` file to your rendered template pages.  In app.js, create three variables: 
    * one variable called ‘pizza’ with a value that contains the string ‘I like my pizza with extra pineapple.’ 
    * one variable called ‘cappuccino’ with a value that contains the string ‘I like my cappuccino to be sweet.’
    * another variable called ‘fries’ with a value that contains the string ‘I like my fries crispy with extra salt.
